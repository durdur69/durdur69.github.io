I'm a researcher with a background in cognitive science, philosophy of mind, applied ethics, and data science/statistics.

Right now, I'm thinking about or working on the following topics:

  * The efficacy, ethics and economics of gene-editing, gene drives, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and other biotechnologies. I discuss these topics at [The Frameshift](https://theframeshift.com).
  * The importance of economic growth for ensuring humanity has a future. How much latent human capital is out there going unused and how can we discover and nurture it? I discuss this is my essay [Radical Educational Meritocracy](https://adamlgreen.com/education-policy/).
  * Mechanisms to improve collective sense- and decision-making to ensure humanity survives through the 22nd century (e.g., variants of prediction markets, which I discuss in my essay on [Replication Markets](https://adamlgreen.com/replication-markets/)).

The purpose of the blog is to share what I find provocative or valuable.
